# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize tasked me and my teammate Omar to create a summary Dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type. We were also tasked to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we were tasked to write a summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer.

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.scv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Pandas Dataframe 1.3.4, MatPlotLib 3.4.3
- Total Fare by City Type Graphical Analysis: https://github.com/Neekoh1310/PyBer_Analysis/blob/07ce203a7214ec90f79e1cb4d12520ba1d07fd46/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png

## Results:

# Total Rides for each city type:
    - Based on the data analyzed, the city type "Urban" has the most number of rides.
    - Rural: 125 rides
    - Suburban: 625 rides
    - Urban: 1,625 rides
    
# Total Drivers for each city type:
    - Based on the data analyzed, the city type "Urban" has the most amount of drivers.
    - Rural: 75 drivers
    - Suburban: 490 drivers
    - Urban: 2,405 drivers
    
# Total amount of Fares for each city type:
    - Based on the data analyzed, the city type "Urban" produced the most fares.
    - Rural: $4,327.93
    - Suburban: $19,356.33
    - Urban: $39,854.38
 
 # Amerage amount of fare per driver for each city type:
    - Based on the data analyzed, the city type "Rural"  has the highest amount of fare per driver.
    - Rural: $55.49
    - Suburban: $39.50
    - Urban: $16.57
        
 # Three business recommendations to the CEO addressing any disparities among the city types.
    - In order to yield the highest amount of rides and available drivers, we should focus on launching PyBer on cities that have the classification "Urban."
    - In order to yield the highest amount of fares, we should focus on launching PyBer on cities that have the classifciation "Urban."
    - In order to yield the highest average fare per driver, we should focus on launching PyBer on cities that have the classification "Rural."
